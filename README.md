## Issue N1

Problem: Some company items in the component are hidden on mobile devices.
Solution: Add the left companies to the company list.

## Issue N2

Problem: Unable to download images.
Solution: Take screenshots of images at 100% screen size.

## Issue N3

Problem: The provided pixels in the Figma design aren't correct for working on every device screen with full width and fill.
Solution: I changed the units from pixels (px) to viewport width (vw) as defined by the design. Now, the design is consistent across all devices and screens, without any additional empty spaces.
